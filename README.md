Data Structures: Stacks + Generics in Java

Today I worked with one of the most classical structures in computer science: the stack!

A stack follows LIFO principle - Last In, First Out. The last element to enter the stack is the first to get out of it.

Besides understanding better how this structure works, I also learned something fundamental to write reusable and secure code: the use of parameterized classes with the use of generics in Java!

## 👨‍💻 Highlights:

- Stack<T> class accepts any type of data.
- I used insert() to add element on top of the stack
- I used remove() to remove element from the top of the stack 
- I verified whether the stack was empty or not with the help of empty() method

## 🧠 Learning of the day 
- How a stack works "behind the curtains"
- How Generics make our classes more safe and reusable, without unecessary casts.
- Practiced personalized types with Piece class. 

## ✔️ Main uses for stacks:
- Browsing through pages (history)
- Backtracking algorithms
- Call stacks
